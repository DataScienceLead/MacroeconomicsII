# Exercise 5
We have seen how the marginal propensity to consume and the parameter that determines the interest rate sensitivity of the consumer affect the IS equation. In this assignment, we will use Excel (or another suitable analysis tool, such as STATA or Python) to find these two parameters.
The consumption function of the IS-RR-PK model is given by:
C = z<sup>C</sup> + c<sub>1</sup> (Y-T) â€“ c<sub>2</sub> (i-&pi;<sup>e</sub>)

The challenge with this equation is that C and Y-T are increasing over time (this is called non-stationary variables). In contrast, the real interest rate, (i-&pi;<sup>e</sub>), is a more or less stationary variable. A stationary variable is a variable that, quite simply, does not have a rising or falling trend.
