Download figures for GDP, Consumption (public and private), Investments og Export-Import, from
the homepage of Statistisk sentralbyrå: www.ssb.no/knr and the StatBank

Tip: Search for the table: "Makroøkonomiske hovedstørrelser, 09190" and use data with fixed 2016-
prices and sesonal adjusted.

1. Make a plot where you show development in the macroeconomic situation from 1978 untill 2018
2. Make a plot where you show Trend-GNP, og GNP and the GNP-gap as the difference
between these variables. If you smooth the figures (weighted average), then it will be easier to read your figures
